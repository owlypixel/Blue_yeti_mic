## What is this?
This is my submission for the Inspect podcast contest. The most challenging part of this CSS puzzle was to create a head and a stand. Here I used pretty typical CSS images approach with lots of absolutely positioned elements. 
You can play around and experiment with it [here](https://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/BZqeme) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### JS
- Changing classes on DOM elements using regular JavaScript
- Making rotating knobs using Draggable from GreenSock

### CSS
- Using linear gradients as backgrounds to create realistically looking objects
- Rounding corners using arc of ellipse
- Absolute positioning practice
